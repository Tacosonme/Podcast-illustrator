[00:008.8 - 00:013.9] Are you guys on that you guys should back? I did I did I literally backed it up. I was like you back me up on this
[00:018.1 - 00:021.4] No, I'd literally said I was like I I'm dealing with similar thing there
[00:022.8 - 00:026.0] It's just easier to go yeah, you're probably right yeah, of course easier
[00:026.8 - 00:029.4] We were driving in the car. I want to listen to music and
[00:030.4 - 00:036.3] He was talking about how it Donald Trump is racist, so I just said yeah, maybe you know hand him the fucking mic
[00:038.9 - 00:040.8] Now you liked Obama's
[00:040.8 - 00:046.6] Obama's deportation record you don't want Trump to come close to the record that he said he's trying to get the record
[00:046.8 - 00:048.8] He's trying to get the record right now
[00:049.2 - 00:055.2] And people seem to somehow forget Obama set the record, baby. Yeah, I didn't know that that's kind of crazy Obama
[00:055.2 - 01:000.6] What's also he literally said he's like I'm going to do this and now he's doing that's what everyone voted for yeah
[01:000.6 - 01:002.9] We should probably fix that so it's like you know
[01:003.8 - 01:007.6] My heart bleeds if there's there's lads close to me if I heard they got kicked out. I'd like damn
[01:007.6 - 01:014.6] I I think they my bro, but I don't think it's as they've been clear that they're not there. They're starting from the
[01:015.4 - 01:022.0] Starting at the top they get the guys that the bad guys bad hombres the hombres that have done bad and hombres bad Canucks
[01:022.0 - 01:027.6] You know hold the whole fucking mixed bag. You should get some bad Canucks. I wouldn't mind. It was nice during that Vietnam thing
[01:028.2 - 01:032.0] About 30,000 Americans went to Canada to yeah dodge it
[01:032.7 - 01:039.3] 30,000 Canadians volunteered whoa yeah for real knocks were ready to fight damn. They want a piece of the Viet Cong
[01:039.4 - 01:045.1] Holy shit, that's kind of crazy. It's a good on the Canucks. That's mad. It's been up and cannot again
[01:045.1 - 01:047.0] I cannot get up in Canada
[01:047.5 - 01:053.6] Nothing in Canada, I'm just being like fuck it. I'm gonna go Vietnam just slam the
[01:054.5 - 01:056.5] Vietnam
[01:057.1 - 01:059.1] But yeah, I've been hit with similar
[01:059.6 - 02:004.0] Concerns like Brittany's it should like did you hear about this and I like she's not like really spazzing about it
[02:004.0 - 02:007.8] But she'll get a thing on her phone. I'm like just Google one article man. Yeah, I
[02:008.8 - 02:013.9] Guarantee yeah, it's not what it says it is and she's like oh, yeah fuck. I'm like dude everything
[02:013.9 - 02:015.9] I read if it's like crazy. It's carding a guarantee
[02:016.0 - 02:020.4] It's a GG didn't they just release like was it the Twitter files where it was like this is state-sponsored
[02:021.0 - 02:024.4] No one cares probably. I think the Twitter files were just saying
[02:025.4 - 02:031.5] The Biden administration was like don't don't let people share this type of information. Oh, yeah, they would decide what was being shared
[02:031.5 - 02:033.7] Yeah, it's like that should be a huge issue
[02:033.7 - 02:038.5] I know it's not but everyone knew they were doing it like they were literally but if you like said anything about Kovac
[02:038.5 - 02:040.7] They were like they were freezing your fucking whole account
[02:040.7 - 02:044.8] they were like openly doing it too, and then probably yeah, just like steering it, but now it's like I
[02:046.1 - 02:051.0] Think I think Elon's for sure unleashed the floodgates if like anything the Biden's are trying to hold back
[02:051.0 - 02:054.0] I think Elon has pushed the gas pedal. Yes, it's X's
[02:055.4 - 02:056.7] X's
[02:056.7 - 03:001.2] Almost unusable pop. I don't get on there dude. I thought of a new I'm a blue ski, man
[03:001.2 - 03:007.5] I want to go on blue ski and just post fucking Pepe the frog take the Isis beheadings blue skis
[03:008.3 - 03:012.8] Blue ski needs some beheading so I don't want fired up. Let's just get some Ukraine drone footage over to blue ski
[03:015.0 - 03:019.3] Yeah, I do I thought of a new now that I'm all blockchain decentralized
[03:019.3 - 03:025.2] I thought of a new blockchain podcast technology where it's like so you could do a thing where I could talk for like
[03:025.6 - 03:028.7] Five minutes and be like okay, blah blah blah. Here's my idea
[03:028.7 - 03:033.6] It's a blockchain podcast and then you listen to it and you talk for five minutes and you kick it down the blockchain
[03:033.6 - 03:040.1] Somebody else now we put together the longest podcast ever yeah, and it's just it's completely disjointed ramblings of like 30 people
[03:041.0 - 03:043.2] It's not bad. We're pretty sick. Yes
[03:044.0 - 03:047.7] Podchain podchain technology yes, and then we release a coin
[03:047.7 - 03:051.6] We'd have to get a coin ourselves, and we rugpull then we make 25 million dollars
[03:051.6 - 03:055.1] We rugpull and then we rugpull dude, and then we take a nap like hock to it
[03:056.9 - 03:058.9] I'm sleepy
[03:059.5 - 04:001.5] Fuck I'm sleepy
[04:004.3 - 04:006.9] That is actually the ultimate girl move in an argument
[04:007.6 - 04:012.8] She's in trouble. I didn't sleep. Well. I'm tired. I'm done with this argument. I have to sleep for four days, okay
[04:012.8 - 04:017.1] You know what I can't do this right now, and you're like yeah, you know yeah, I guess you were losing that argument
[04:019.5 - 04:021.5] You rage quit the argument
[04:021.7 - 04:027.1] Yeah, you know hibernate it's pretty hock to it dude obviously she had no fucking idea what that was yeah
[04:027.1 - 04:031.3] I mean no offense to her. I know that sounds like I'm calling her a fucking dumbass, but that was her whole thing

[07:001.2 - 07:003.9] That was my idea. I've come to the conclusion that
[07:004.6 - 07:010.7] They both thought of the idea on the grounds that they're both gigantic whores and that's what gigantic whores think about
[07:011.7 - 07:016.3] I think so. It's like wait a second. There's a chance they're both
[07:016.9 - 07:018.9] whores
